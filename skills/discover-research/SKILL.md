## Progressive Loading

Load skills progressively based on research phase:

**Phase 1: Planning** (Load 1-2 skills)
- research-design (always)
- quantitative-methods OR qualitative-methods (based on approach)

**Phase 2: Collection** (Add 1-2 skills)
- data-collection (always)
- Keep loaded: specific method skill

**Phase 3: Analysis** (Add 1 skill)
- data-analysis (always)
- Keep loaded: method and collection skills for reference

**Phase 4: Writing** (Add 1 skill, can unload others)
- research-writing (always)
- research-synthesis (if synthesizing literature)
- Keep one method skill for reporting details

**Phase 5: Synthesis** (If conducting review)
- research-synthesis (load early)
- quantitative-methods (if meta-analysis)
- qualitative-methods (if thematic synthesis)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with design**: Load research-design first when planning new studies
2. **Method-specific loading**: Load only the method skill you need (quant OR qual)
3. **Progressive addition**: Add skills as you progress through research phases
4. **Unload when done**: Unload skills from completed phases to manage context
5. **Keep writing loaded**: research-writing useful throughout for documentation

## Skill Maintenance

All research skills follow these standards:
- Practical code examples (Python primary, R when appropriate)
- Real-world templates and protocols
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Cross-references to related skills
- 250-400 lines optimized for context efficiency

## Integration with Other Skills

Research skills integrate well with:
- **python-data-science**: For advanced analysis
- **python-visualization**: For publication graphics
- **academic-latex**: For paper formatting
- **git-workflow**: For research project management
