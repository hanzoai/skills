## React vs Next.js Decision

**Use React (Vite)** when:
- Building SPAs or client-heavy apps
- Don't need SSR or SSG
- Want full control over routing
- Building component libraries

**Use Next.js** when:
- Need SEO (Server-Side Rendering)
- Want file-based routing
- Need API routes
- Building full-stack apps
- Want optimal performance out of the box

## State Management Decision

**Use Component State (useState)** when:
- State is local to a component
- Simple state that doesn't need sharing

**Use Context** when:
- Sharing state across a few components
- Theme, auth, or user preferences
- Not frequently updated

**Use Zustand** when:
- Need global state
- Want simple API
- State updates are moderate

**Use Redux Toolkit** when:
- Complex state logic
- Need middleware (sagas, thunks)
- Large team with established patterns
- Time-travel debugging needed

For detailed guidance:
```bash
cat skills/frontend/react-state-management.md
```

## Data Fetching Decision

**Server Components** (Next.js App Router):
- Default choice for Next.js 14+
- Fetch on server, zero client JS
- Direct database access

**Server Actions** (Next.js):
- For mutations and form handling
- Progressive enhancement
- Type-safe with TypeScript

**SWR**:
- Client-side data fetching
- Built-in caching
- Optimistic updates
- Focus on user experience

**React Query**:
- Advanced caching strategies
- Complex data dependencies
- Offline support
- DevTools for debugging

For detailed patterns:
```bash
cat skills/frontend/react-data-fetching.md
```
