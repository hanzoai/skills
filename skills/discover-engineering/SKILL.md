# Engineering Skills Discovery

Provides automatic access to comprehensive engineering skills.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill auto-activates when you're working with:
- engineering practices
- code review
- documentation
- team collaboration
- technical leadership

## Available Skills

### Quick Reference

The Engineering category contains 14 skills:

**Software Development Practices:**
1. **code-review** - PR reviews, feedback, automation
2. **code-quality** - SOLID principles, metrics, code smells
3. **refactoring-patterns** - Safe refactoring techniques
4. **test-driven-development** - TDD, red-green-refactor
5. **domain-driven-design** - DDD patterns, bounded contexts
6. **functional-programming** - FP principles, immutability
7. **design-patterns** - GoF patterns, when to use
8. **technical-debt** - Identifying and managing debt
9. **pair-programming** - Pairing techniques, mob programming
10. **continuous-integration** - CI/CD pipelines, deployment

**RFC & Documentation:**
11. **rfc-consensus-building** - Stakeholder collaboration
12. **rfc-decision-documentation** - ADRs, decision tracking
13. **rfc-structure-format** - RFC templates, formatting
14. **rfc-technical-design** - Architecture proposals
