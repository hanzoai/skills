# Skills Discovery Assistant

You are helping the user discover and activate relevant skills from their skills library at `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Your Task

**User's Request:** `$ARGUMENTS`

Follow these steps:

### 1. Read Skills Index

First, read the master skills catalog:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/_INDEX.md
```

### 2. Detect Project Context

Analyze the current directory to understand the project:
```bash
# List files to detect project type
ls -la | head -30

# Check for language/framework indicators
ls *.{json,md,go,py,rs,swift,zig,toml,yaml,yml} 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

**Technology Detection:**
- `package.json` → JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js → Frontend skills
- `go.mod` → Go → TUI (Bubble Tea), API, or CLI skills
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` → Python → uv, API, or ML skills
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust → TUI (Ratatui), systems programming
- `build.zig` → Zig → Zig-specific skills
- `*.swift`, `*.xcodeproj` → Swift/iOS → iOS skills
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` → Container skills
- `.beads/` → Beads workflow skills
- `tests/`, `__tests__/` → Testing skills

### 3. Analyze Conversation Context

Review the current conversation for:
- Technologies mentioned (frameworks, tools, databases)
- Problems discussed (performance, debugging, deployment)
- Explicit skill requests
- Work phase (planning, implementation, testing, deployment)

### 4. Provide Contextual Recommendations

Based on the argument provided:

**If NO ARGUMENT (default view):**

Display in this format:
```
━━━ SKILLS DISCOVERY ━━━

RECOMMENDED FOR THIS PROJECT:
→ [skill-name] - [one-line description]
→ [skill-name] - [one-line description]
→ [skill-name] - [one-line description]

CATEGORIES (135 total skills):
Frontend (9) | Database (11) | API (7) | Testing (6) | Containers (5)
Workflow (6) | iOS (6) | Modal (8) | Networking (5) | TUI (5) | Zig (6)
[View full catalog: ~/.claude/skills/_INDEX.md]

COMMANDS:
/skills frontend     - View all Frontend skills
/skills postgres     - Search for 'postgres' skills
/skills list         - Show all categories with descriptions
```

Recommend 3-5 skills that match:
- Detected technologies in the current directory
- Topics discussed in conversation
- Common workflows for the project type

**If ARGUMENT = category name:**

Display all skills in that category with:
- Skill filename
- Description from _INDEX.md
- When to use it
- Lines of documentation

Example for `/skills frontend`:
```
━━━ FRONTEND SKILLS (9 skills) ━━━

react-component-patterns.md (~320 lines)
  → Component design, composition, hooks, performance
  → Use when: Building React components, optimizing renders

nextjs-app-router.md (~340 lines)
  → Next.js App Router, Server Components, routing
  → Use when: Building Next.js applications with App Router

[... continue for all skills in category ...]

RELATED CATEGORIES:
Testing (6) | API (7) | Database (11)

[Back to overview: /skills]
```

**If ARGUMENT = search term:**

Fuzzy search across:
- Skill filenames
- Skill descriptions
- Category names
- "Use when" triggers

Display matching skills ranked by relevance:
```
━━━ SEARCH RESULTS: 'postgres' ━━━

EXACT MATCHES:
→ postgres-query-optimization.md - Database/Performance
  Debug slow queries, EXPLAIN plans, index design

→ postgres-migrations.md - Database/Schema
  Schema changes, zero-downtime deployments

→ postgres-schema-design.md - Database/Design
  Designing schemas, relationships, data types

RELATED:
→ database-selection.md - Choosing databases (mentions Postgres)
→ orm-patterns.md - ORM usage (works with Postgres)

[Refine search: /skills postgres optimization]
[View category: /skills database]
```

**If ARGUMENT = "list":**

Show all categories with counts and descriptions:
```

### 5. Output Requirements

**Format Guidelines:**
- Use Unicode box drawing (━ ─ │) for section headers
- Keep output under 25 lines for default view
- Use `→` for list items
- Include actionable next steps
- Show file paths for easy reference
- Keep descriptions to one line each
- Group related items logically

**Tone:**
- Helpful and direct
- Low noise, high signal
- Focus on relevance to current work
- Encourage exploration without overwhelming

**DO NOT:**
- Modify any skill files
- Create new skills
- Change _INDEX.md
- Make assumptions about skills you haven't read
- Display full skill contents (only summaries)

### 6. Graceful Fallbacks

**If _INDEX.md not found:**
```
Skills index not found at ~/.claude/skills/_INDEX.md

Expected location: ~/.claude/skills/

Is your skills directory in a different location?
```

**If no matches for search:**
```
No skills found matching '$ARGUMENTS'

Try:
- Broader search term
- View all categories: /skills list
- Browse full index: ~/.claude/skills/_INDEX.md
```

**If empty project directory:**
```
━━━ SKILLS DISCOVERY ━━━

No project files detected in current directory.

GENERAL-PURPOSE SKILLS:
→ beads-workflow.md - Multi-session task management
→ skill-creation.md - Creating new atomic skills

[View all: /skills list]
[Search: /skills api]
```

## Remember

- This is a **discovery tool** - help users find relevant skills
- Read _INDEX.md to get accurate information
- Match skills to project context when possible
- Keep output concise and actionable
- Never modify the skills library
- Encourage exploration with clear commands
